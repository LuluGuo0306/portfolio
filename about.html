          <p>I am a User Experience Researcher / Designe who is passionate about building communications between humans and technologies, solving real problems for people.</p>
          <p>When we live in an environment with developed technologies, we may sometimes forget those people behind us, those who need help but couldnâ€™t get enough resources as we do, those who may as clever as us but never saw what we see every day. My ambition is to help them to live in a fair world, to get an equal footing, to live better.</p>

      <h2 id="gallery">My journey of regainning my hair</h2>
      <p>In the summer of 2017, I made the bold decision to shave my head. You might think that I must have gone through something sad, like a breakup or an illness. In fact, it was none of those things; it was just a perfectly ordinary summer, and I was feeling a little hot. As it turns out, my baldness really cooled off my summer and made for a memorable experience.</p>

      <p>Here's how my hair grew during that first year</p>
